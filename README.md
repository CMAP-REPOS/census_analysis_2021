# Census analysis: 2021

This repo contains code used in the production of recently published CMAP analysis on the U.S. Census, which reviews recently released data on population trends in Illinois and the seven-county CMAP region in northeastern Illinois.

CMAP relied on the following sources:
- State-level population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's [Population Estimates Program](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html).
- Demographic information from the 2005-09, 2010-14, and 2015-19 five-year American Community Survey (ACS).
- State-to-state [migration flows](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/state-to-state-migration.html) from 2019, based on one-year ACS data.
- A list of counties included in each of the U.S.'s Metropolitan Statistical Areas (as of March 2020), which was obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, [here](https://apps.bea.gov/regional/docs/msalist.cfm).
